# PyCitySchools
The PyCity Schools project analyzed 15 high schools across one district. Raw data was composed of two csv files, ‘schools_complete.csv’ and ‘students_complete.csv’.
Schools_complete.csv comprised school-specific information, including school type, student population size and budget.
Accordingly, students_complete.csv comprised student information such as grade, gender, high school, and reading & math scores.
The two files were combined, and the aggregated data was stratified and organized into visually compelling tables that illustrated data relationships,
leading to ‘potentially actionable’ insights and decisions on the part of district-wide leaders and legislators.
The programming for the analysis was completed with a pandas-python data analytics tool.
Successful execution required extensive study of panda-python coding processes and syntax, consultation with GW Bootcamp instructor and an occasional tutoring session.
