    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCity Schools project analyzed 15 high schools across one district.  Raw data was composed of two csv files, â€˜schools_complete.csvâ€™ and â€˜students_complete.csvâ€™.  Schools_complete.csv comprised school-specific information, including school type, student population size and budget.  Accordingly,  students_complete.csv comprised student information such as grade, gender, high school, and reading & math scores.  The two files were combined, and the aggregated data was stratified and organized into visually compelling tables that illustrated data relationships, leading to â€˜potentially actionableâ€™ insights and decisions on the part of district-wide leaders and legislators.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, charter schools outperform their traditional public school counterparts across all four grades in math and reading curricula.  Our analysis shows the top five highest performing schools (in both math and reading) are all charter, and no charter school is among the five lowest performing.  Could it be that charter schools having the freedom to tailor their own curriculum, intrinsically requires that they invest more time and consideration in identifying the needs of their students and the factors that most contribute to their academic success. Additionally, this freedom likely comes with the power to efficiently and creatively implement changes in quick turn-around time, all with the intention of improving student performance outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, larger schools do not fare as well as their smaller counterparts.  The fact that in our data, all non-charter, i.e., â€˜districtâ€™, schools are categorized as â€˜largeâ€™, compared to only one â€˜large-sizedâ€™ charter does indeed impede the hasty conclusion that â€˜big is badâ€™.  As well, one â€˜large-sizedâ€™, a charter, Wilson High School, is among the five highest performing schools.  And further, the fact that the majority of  higher performing schools are categorized as â€˜mediumâ€™, reveals that, likewise, â€˜smallâ€™ does not necessarily mean â€˜betterâ€™.  Note, only one â€˜smallâ€™ school is among the top performers. \n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, these observations do not necessarily throw out the possibility that â€˜largeâ€™ institutions may have challenges impacting student success that are directly related to their size.  For instance, consider larger teacher-to-student ratios, or in other words, larger class sizes.  Larger overall staff-to-student ratios, which would include support mentors such as coaches, counselors, and safety officers, may also be a contributing factor.  Simply put, the impact of larger ratios leading to students having less one-on-one time with adult mentors invested in their success cannot be overlooked\n",
    "In addition, the highest â€˜per student capitaâ€™ spending is found among the larger schools.  Clearly, it costs more to run a larger institution, but it is the â€˜per-capitaâ€™ funding which stands out here.  In fact, four of the five top â€˜per-capitaâ€™ spenders were among the lowest performing institutions. This may indeed reinforce the fact that â€˜money spentâ€™ cannot make up for the lack of one-on-one time with support staff, be it teachers or other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, a sample size of 15 schools within one â€˜un-namedâ€™ district, and only a handful of analytic variables, is likely not enough to make wide-sweeping conclusions with regard to public education as a whole.  Additional school district socioeconomic and demographic information would be greatly helpful.  As well, bringing in data from surrounding districts, and perhaps that from other states, may lead to comparisons which either reinforce or dispel the insights proposed above, all of which could provide a cornucopia of impactful factors manifest in much needed decision-making wisdom ðŸ˜Š.\n",
